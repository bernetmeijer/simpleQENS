# simpleQENS

This repository contains code for the analysis of quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS). It makes use of the lmfit package and qef package (https://pypi.org/project/qef/).
It streamlines the workflow of QENS analysis and adds onto some features in the qef package. 

Prerequisites:
- lmfit 0.9.15
- qef 0.2.3

Make sure you have these exact versions, otherwise code might break.
